check in table 3 and table 4 for elements, compounds, and mixtures that are already done

if not, go to:
https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Xcom/html/xcom1.html

choose element, compound, or mixture
choose "Additional energies from file"
submit info

put in formula for compound, element, etc
optional output title, graph options dont matter
upload 'XCOM_energies.txt' file for the additional energies
make sure "Include the standard grid" is checked
dont change energy range
submit info

make sure delimiter is space
check all boxes for scattering coherent, incoherent, photoelectric, etc
click download data

copy and paste / save output into a .txt file with the title name of the chemical formula

also find density and put in 'material_densities.txt' with the same chemical formula name

optionally, put nicknames in 'CdEquivalentName.m' if the material has nicknames
